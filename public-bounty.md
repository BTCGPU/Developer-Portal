# Public Bounty Program

Public Bounty Program offers a place for the communtiy to help Bitcoin Gold development. The program is based on GitHub issue system where people can create bug report & feature request, discuss, and track the process of the development.

In addition to the regular open source workflow, we introduce bounty for tasks. You can get rewarded after finishing the tasks.

## I'm a Bounty Hunter

Find the tasks in Developer Portal [issue page](https://github.com/BTCGPU/dev/issues) and earn bounties!

To get the bounty, your solution need to meet all the requirements described in the issue. When you complete the task, submit your Pull Request and reply to the issue. A dev team member will handle the rest and send you the bounty after the confirmation.

Sometimes when the solution involves more than one contributor, the dev team will decide how to split the bounty to multiple parties based on the contribution.

## I have a feature request or a bug report

Simply create a GitHub issue in the developer portal [here](https://github.com/BTCGPU/dev/issues). You need to describe the feature you request or the bug you want to report. Please also describe the technical requirements for the fix if you can. Please leave the tag section empty and don't add "[Bounty]" prefix in the title.

Example: https://github.com/BTCGPU/dev/issues/1

After the issue is created, the dev team will review your issue, assign tags, put a expiration date, or add dev bounty to it. The process may take some time and may involve further discussion witht the community.

**Be careful: don't post critical vulnerabilities here.** Instead please check our [Responsible Disclosure Program](responsible-disclosure.md).

## I want to donate to an issue

In addition to coding and discussion, you can also shwo your support to the fix by donation. The more the donation the issue has, the more likely it can be completed by Bounty Hunters.

(While the dev team is preparing for the automated donation management system, you can still donate to the wallet manually created by @h4x3rotab)
