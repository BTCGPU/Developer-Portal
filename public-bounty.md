# Public Bounty Program

The Public Bounty Program offers a place for the community to help Bitcoin Gold development. The program is based on the GitHub issue system where people can create bug reports & feature requests, discuss, and track the process of development.

In addition to the regular open source workflow, we provide bounty for certain tasks. You can earn rewards for finishing the tasks.

## I'm a Bounty Hunter

Find tasks in the Developer Portal [issue page](https://github.com/BTCGPU/dev/issues) and earn bounties!

> [Bounty:2] Enable Compact Block in Core Wallet

Take the first issue as an example. `[Bounty:2]` means the bounty for the task offered by the dev team is $200 (USD).

To get the bounty, your solution needs to meet all the requirements described in the issue. When you complete the task, submit your Pull Request and reply to the issue. A dev team member will handle the rest and send you the bounty after confirmation.

If the solution involves more than one contributor, the dev team will decide how to split the bounty to multiple parties based on the contributions.

## I have a feature request or a bug report

Simply create a GitHub issue in the developer portal [here](https://github.com/BTCGPU/dev/issues). You need to describe the feature you request or the bug you want to report. For bugs, try to include exact steps to replicate. Please also describe the technical requirements for the fix if you can. Leave the tag section empty and don't add the "[Bounty]" prefix in the title.

Example: https://github.com/BTCGPU/dev/issues/1

After the issue is created, the dev team may review your issue, assign tags, assign an expiration date, or add dev bounty to it. The process may take some time and may involve further discussion with the community.

**Be careful: don't post critical vulnerabilities!** For critical issues, please check our [Responsible Disclosure Program](responsible-disclosure.md).

## I want to donate to an issue

In addition to coding and discussion, you can also show your support for the work via donation. The more donations an issue has, the more likely it is to be completed by Bounty Hunters.

(While the dev team is planning to produce an automated donation system, you can still donate to the wallet manually created by @h4x3rotab.)

## How does it work
